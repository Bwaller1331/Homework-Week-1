### **My Task**
***

#### **I was given the source code for this site and asked to make it meet the following criteria
```
 **GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards**
    - WHEN I view the source code
       - THEN I find semantic HTML elements
    - WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
       - THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    - WHEN I view the image elements
       - THEN I find accessible alt attributes
    - WHEN I view the heading attributes
       - THEN they fall in sequential order
    - WHEN I view the title element
       - THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

#### **I believe I Have Satisfied those criteria based on these changes:**
```
    - Added "Heriseon Social Solutions" to the title of the page

       * - This allows the user to more easily identify the site in the browser
    
    - Added Nav, Figure, Section, and Article tags to the appropriate parts of the document

       * - This makes the document more accurate and readable

    - Fixed broken Search-Engine-Optimization link in the heading

       * - Makes the site function as intended by aiding the user in navigation

    - Moved "digital-marketing-meeting.jpg" from the style sheet into the html and Removed unnecessary <img> tag

       * - This corrected the flow of the document, bringing the image into the html with the other images
```
